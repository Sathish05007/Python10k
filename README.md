This is my day-by-day learning journey, written in detail for **Python** along with other key activities.

Learned about **variables** (naming rules, assignment), **data types** (int, float, str, bool, NoneType). Practiced printing and type checking.

Studied **operators** (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment). Learned **lists** (creation, indexing, updating). 

Learned **string methods** (upper, lower, strip, replace) and **list methods** (append, extend, insert, remove, pop, sort).

Learned **sets** (unique elements, set methods), **tuples** (immutable collections), and **dictionaries** (key-value storage, CRUD operations). 

Learned **if statements**, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` structures. Practiced decision-making problems. 

Introduction to **for loops** â€” iterating over lists, strings, ranges. 

Solved **problem-solving tasks** using for loops (sum of numbers, factorial, reverse string).
