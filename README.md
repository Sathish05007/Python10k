This is my day-by-day learning journey, written in detail for **Python** along with other key activities.

DAY 01:-Learned about **variables** (naming rules, assignment), **data types** (int, float, str, bool, NoneType). Practiced printing and type checking.

DAY 02:-Studied **operators** (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment). Learned **lists** (creation, indexing, updating). 

DAY 03:-Learned **string methods** (upper, lower, strip, replace) and **list methods** (append, extend, insert, remove, pop, sort).

DAY 04:-Learned **sets** (unique elements, set methods), **tuples** (immutable collections), and **dictionaries** (key-value storage, CRUD operations). 

DAY 06:-Learned **if statements**, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` structures. Practiced decision-making problems. 

DAY 07:-Introduction to **for loops** — iterating over lists, strings, ranges. 

DAY 08:-Solved **problem-solving tasks** using for loops (sum of numbers, factorial, reverse string).  

DAY 09:-Learned **while loops** for repetition until a condition is false. 

DAY 10:-**Python:** Solved problems using **for** and **while loops** — printing sequences, sums, and factorials.  

DAY 12:-**Problem Solving :** Focused on logical thinking with small programs. 

DAY 13:-Learned about **functions in Python** to create reusable blocks of code.
Explored function definition, parameters, return values, and function calls with examples.

DAY 14:-Practiced **list comprehensions** in Python for creating lists in a single line.
Explored conditions, nested loops, and expressions inside list comprehensions.

DAY 15:-Explored Python **built-in methods for strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries**.racticed using methods like len(), append(), pop(), sort(), upper(), lower(), keys(), values() and more.

DAY 16:-Practiced **pattern printing** in Python using loops.
Created star patterns, number patterns, and pyramid structures with nested for loops.

DAY 17:-FOR **LOOP IN SEQUENCE  DATA** (LIST,STR,DICT,SET)

DAY 18:-**OOPS IN PYTHON**,Its four main pillars are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

DAY 19:-**CLASS & OBJECT** in python
